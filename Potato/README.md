Module functions are explained in the wiki. We discuss one file not touched upon in the wiki:

## csvNameFile.txt

This file lists, in this particular order, the filename of the CSV for the crop being investigated and then, secondly, the name of the crop itself in lower case.

Every crop has a directory, and every directory has identical code but in a few locations mentioned as a comment in the code. Functions are made particular to a type of crop using this text file, in which we list the crop's csv file name and then the name of the crop.

# Potato_Tomato_Sweetcorn

This library contains code to analyze potato, tomato and sweetcorn yield data. It:

* Preprocesses and cleans raw data
* Checks if the data obeys assumptions that were used to create prediction functions.
* Constructs models of preprocessed/cleaned data and saves them.
* Constructs visualizations using these models.

## Getting Started

This library is self-contained. You do not need to add anything to it to use it. Importantly, it already contains the CSV data that Aahan Agrawal was passed around the beginning of August to model the titular crops. **Please read the wiki to understand how to use the code in this library.**

### Prerequisites

The files in this library were built using Python 3.6 and R 3.4.4. All programs were run from the command line, so you need to have python and R executables somewhere in your PATH.

It is not known whether these files can run using any older version of Python or R. To check what version of R or Python you have, assuming that your PATH can access your Python and R executables, run

```
R
```
and

```
python
```

in your command line. You should be greeted with the current version of a corresponding language on your system. Beware that the version printed after invoking these commands will be that version which is accessible using your PATH.

### Installing

<!--A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running-->

<!--Say what the step will be-->
